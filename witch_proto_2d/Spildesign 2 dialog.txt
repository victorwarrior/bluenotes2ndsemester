Dialog:

Where do we want the dialogue?
	- In the opening of the first section, where the player is learning the mechanics and there is a lot of empty space
	- At the ruined house
	- At the beach
	- Maybe at the circle, similar to how Furi does it?

Purpose of dialogue:
	- Exposition
	- Relationship between characters
	- Adding personality to the game
	- Telling a story

What is the story of the level?
	- We arrive, seeing the dead land. This presents a clear goal which is finding a way to heal it.
	- However, the enemy is too powerful, requiring you to run away and regroup, so you can come back later.

Who are the characters?
	- Bridget
		- Player character
		- Curious: This makes sense since it is a game about discovery
		- Misses her mother
		- Dutyful
		- Spoiled?
		- Sample dialogue: "This place looks... dead". "Does this place seems  somewhat more dead than everywhere else?"
	- Macha
		- Knowledgeable
		- Mentor figure
		- Arrogant
		- Sample dialogue: "Just do it. Are you a druid or not?"
	- Nuckelavee
		- Evil beast
		- Angry, murderous
		- Sample dialogue: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!", "WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO", "*Howls", "*Angry horse noises."
		
What is the relationship between Bridget and Macha?
	
Simple and functional dialogue:
	Bridget:
		- The stone circle has lost its power! We should search the area and find out why.
	Later...
	Macha:
		- The forest seems dead. It is as if something has sucked out the life of everything here.
	Bridget:
		- If we can heal it, maybe the circle will be restored as well.
	
	Later...
	Macha:
		- Watch out! This farm smells weird...
	
	Later...
	Bridget:
		- What was that!?
	Macha:
		- Grey men... Supposedly, this is what happens when all lifeforce is drained
	
	public class MainController : MonoBehaviour {
		Start(){
			
		}
	}
	
Traumatised Bridget version

	Bridget:
		- ...And you are sure this will help save my mother?
	
	Macha:
		- Of courrse. You drruids are symbiotic with nature. Rrestoring this dead arrea to life will aid you both.
	
	Bridget:
		- I just don't understand why we can't go to her now. Sur
		
	At the house.
	Macha:
		- Wait! This smells-
	
	Bridget:
		- I have no time for your smells! This place was clearly inhabited once, and we need to know what happened. This is the fastest way.
	
	After the house:
	Bridget:
		- By the Gods! What were those things!? What could have possibly caused this!?
	Macha:
		- I thought we did not have time for idle questions, girl. Besides, I trried to warn you.
